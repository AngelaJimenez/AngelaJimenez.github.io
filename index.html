            Hiragana VR is an educational VR game that teaches Japanese food names and improves understanding of food orders. Players listen to orders in Japanese and select the correct dishes to serve, with feedback provided for mistakes. 

            <br>

            A practice mode allows users to review dish names, hear pronunciations, and interact with items to boost vocabulary. I developed all code and UIs, creating an engaging tool for learning Japanese cuisine and language.<br>

            This project aimed to analyze the impact of virtual reality on children's learning of geometry, focusing on students aged 9 to 14. Collaborating with a partner, I developed a Unity environment that we imported into Altspace, a VR platform known for its educational and social interaction capabilities.
            <img src="images/TeachingGeometry3.png" alt="Image" />
            The project involved two main components: first, students observed geometric figures alongside their corresponding equations, allowing them to visualize different transformations. The second part was more interactive, with exercises that required students to identify transformations between figures, encouraging active learning and engagement. 
            <img src="images/TeachingGeometry1.png" alt="Image" />
            
            Feedback from the six participants revealed that VR had a positive effect on their understanding of geometric concepts. This outcome suggests that Altspace is an effective tool for educational purposes, particularly in enhancing both learning and social participation.

            The purpose of this research project was to analyze the limits of the Artificial Intelligence branch specialized in Natural Language Processing (No! this is not a Visual Computing project, this is one I made on AI in order to explore other fields that some day may work on VR). As a result, the idea of this project was to design an algorithm capable of creating a written production made of sentences that follow a logical syntax scheme and a semantics defined by the meaning of each word that is chosen. This algorithm seeks to imitate the process carried out by people who perform the art of freestyle, an activity that consists in producing a type of lyricism characterized by its free and improvised style.
            <img src="images/FreestAIle1.jpg" alt="Image" />
            Therefore, the program receives a limited amount of information to start off picking a theme which will be used to determine the words that should be selected from a pool of vocabulary, either for their meaning or intent, in order to build a coherent sentence.

While it may not have been perfect, it was a significant learning experience that introduced me to the vast opportunities within VR/AR.

            This is my first major project in WebGL, created to practice and learn essential 3D graphics programming concepts. The animation showcases a murder scene with three different viewing perspectives, providing a dynamic exploration of the event. Through this project, I focused on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learning Shape Construction:</strong> Building 3D shapes like cubes, pyramids, and cylinders using vertex buffers and index buffers.</li>
            <li><strong>Understanding Shaders:</strong> Implementing vertex and fragment shaders to control how objects are rendered and appear in the scene.</li>
            <li><strong>Camera Perspective Handling:</strong> Developing the capability to switch between multiple camera views to enrich the storytelling experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Animation Creation:</strong> Crafting realistic animations and effects, such as blood flow and bullet movement, to bring the scene to life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This project represents my first step into the world of WebGL, where I learned to integrate multiple elements to create an engaging 3D animation.</p>

             The Ruins of the Treasure is a game developed in Unreal Engine to learn the platform and explore its blueprint system. With my background in programming and Unity, I created an adventure where players navigate ancient ruins, dodge projectiles from enemy towers, and use their own projectiles to destroy these towers. The ultimate goal is to reach a chest filled with treasure on the other side of the ruins.        
            <img src="images/videoshowUnrealRuinsTreasure.gif" alt="GIF showing the game " >

            I developed several key blueprints for this project, including the <code>enemyshooter</code>, which fires at the player every 3 seconds and self-destructs when hit by the player’s projectile. Another blueprint handles UI updates for the player, changing when damage is taken and managing collision detection to ensure smooth gameplay.
